        <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
      </div>

      --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
      --slate-300: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
      --slate-500: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
      --slate-900: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);

      --para-font-size: 15px;
    }
```



### Useful resources
